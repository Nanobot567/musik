## FAQ

### So how do I get this onto my Playdate?
Visit [this page](https://help.play.date/games/sideloading/) on Playdate's website for information on how to sideload.

### Why though?
When I first created musik, there were no public music players out for playdate (except for Audition, but it wasn't made to be an iPod type music player), so I decided to make one.

### I just found a bug, where do I report it?
Head to the "issues" tab on Github and file a bug report.

### Why aren't my MP3s playing correctly?
Try dragging them into [Audacity](https://audacityteam.org/) and re-exporting them as MP3s with no metadata.

### My Playdate crashes when I try to skip a song...

Yeah, I don't exactly know what is going on there. I think that it's a buffer underflow issue, so as a temporary solution I have made it so you can only skip a song when it has been playing for 5.5 seconds or more, which should resolve most crashes.

### How do I use this thing???

Check out the [user manual](https://github.com/Nanobot567/musik/blob/main/MANUAL.md)!

<!--

upon a farmer's land
a horse removes a grain of sand
from the beach of the human race
and goes back to its home base

the humans know that something's off
but they don't know what, so they shrug it off
one badger, though, follows its trail
walks for hours and hours to no avail

until there it was, surrounded by dead trees and grass
but the badger stays hidden, as that day could be his last
when he stared into its eyes where fires burned
suddenly he knew horse the horse will return
