a music player for playdate

### Why though?
There are no public music players out for playdate yet (except for Audition, but it wasn't made to be a music player), so I decided to make one.

### Controls
When in "files" screen:

- Up/Down - controls the file selection cursor
- A - play song / enter folder
- B - up folder

When in "now playing" screen:
- A - plays / pauses song
- B - exit to files screen
- Right/Left - seek forward / backward 5 seconds (this works best when the song is paused)

In the system menu, there is an options menu item titled "mode". This controls the current playing mode. The options are:
- `none` - plays the song then stops
- `shuffle` - plays a random song in the current folder
- `loop folder` - plays all of the songs in the folder, then loops back to the top and continues
- `loop one` - loops one song
