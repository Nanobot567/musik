a music player for playdate

## FAQ

### Why though?
There are no public music players out for playdate yet (except for Audition, but it wasn't made to be a music player), so I decided to make one.

### I just found a bug, where do I report it?
Head to the "issues" tab on Github and file a bug report.

### Why aren't my MP3s playing correctly?
Try dragging them into [Audacity](https://audacityteam.org/) and re-exporting them as MP3s with no metadata.

## Controls

### When in the "files" screen:

- Up/Down - controls the file selection cursor
- A - play song / enter folder
- B - up folder

### When in the "now playing" screen:
- A - play / pause song
- B - exit to files screen
- Right/Left - seek forward / backward 5 seconds (this works best when the song is paused)

In the system menu, there is an options menu item titled "mode". This controls the current playing mode. The options are:
- `none` - plays the song then stops
- `shuffle` - plays a random song in the current folder
- `loop folder` - plays all of the songs in the folder, then loops back to the top and continues
- `loop one` - loops one song

## Adding songs

To add songs to musik, follow these steps:
1. Put your Playdate into data disk mode (you can do this by opening settings and navigating to `settings / system / reboot to data disk`)
2. Connect your Playdate to your computer and open the `PLAYDATE` drive
3. Navigate to `/Data/user.*****.musik/music/`
4. Drag and drop your MP3s / PDAs!

upon a farmer's land
a horse removes a grain of sand
from the beach of the human race
and goes back to its home base

the humans know that something's off
but they don't know what, so they shrug it off
one badger, though, follows its trail
walks for hours and hours to no avail

until there it was, surrounded by dead trees and grass
but the badger stays hidden, as that day could be his last
when he stared into its eyes where fires burned
suddenly he knew horse the horse will return
